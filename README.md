Volute Geometry for Turbocharger

Following are steps are my algorithm that I have taken to design the volute.

1.Cross section shape (At 360 degrees).
2.Using user given start area fraction building first Cross section.
3.Scale cross sections from 0-360 degrees.
4.Sweep cross sections to make a full 360 degree shape.
5.Adding exit pipe for the volute.
